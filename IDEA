PEERPLAYER
==========

Goal: Separate concerns... 1. Search videos (need: aggregator); 2. Find single video, with unique identifier; 3. PLAY VIDEO IN OWN APPLICATION; 4. redistribute, share video via Bittorrent

1. Search / aggregator / Google replacement ... TODO
2. Identify videos, e.g., size + md5 hash; video hosted on Peertube site A but also on Peertube site B should also be found/playable on B (once found) and even on C if site A disappears and it's reuploaded on C...
  Problem: If the video is reencoded on upload, it's a different file with a different hash...
  So either find a way to upload videos without them being reencoded - or...
  Build some sort of index structure linking different video files.
3./4. PEER PLAYER. IT SHOULD PLAY PEERTUBE VIDEOS (INPUT = PEERTUBE VIDEO URL) AND LATER, IT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE, I.E., SHARE THOSE VIDEOS VIA BITTORRENT.
4. IPFS support?
