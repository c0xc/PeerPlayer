PEERPLAYER - PLAN, AS OF 2022-03-27
===================================

1. PoC (proof of concept): Player widget - play MPEG videos from Peertube
(from a Peertube server or rather: from a channel within an instance)
Either directly, live, streamed; or from a local directory ("incoming"),
which could later be used for sharing (Torrent etc.).

2. Video (and audio!) search and overview widget:
List all videos from a selected source - or from all subscribed channels!
2.1 Peertube
2.2 Odysee !

3. More abstract channel / subscription features? + PLAN: LBRY...
Integrate LBRY's blockchain?

X. Share via: Bittorrent. donkey...
