PeerPlayer
==========

**This is experimental, unfinished software.**

Do not expect it to work. Most (planned) features are missing or incomplete.

With this program, you can subscribe to channels on any Peertube site or on Odysee (themtube is not supported).

* Subscribe to any channel, for example from Odysee. As of now, you need to copy the channel url and click the "+" button to add it.
* Click on a subscribed channel in the overview to open it. The newest videos are shown at the top.
* You can also open a channel without subscribing to it, using the menu at the top.
* Scroll through the channel, click on a video to open it. It'll open and play in a new tab.
* Videos from fully supported sites like Odysee are streamed by default.
* If you like the video, click the Import button to download and save it.
* Downloaded videos are saved in the "Videos" directory.
* Next time you open the same video, it'll play your downloaded copy.
* You can close the program any time and open it another day to keep watching, your tabs are automatically restored.
* You can keep many tabs open, memory usage will not be as horrific like with Firefox.

PEERPLAYER - initial thoughts - 2022-04
(original idea: mid 2021)

Goal: Want to subscribe to video channels, see their newest videos and play them - all in one program.
Download and keep interesting videos for later because videos can be deleted, channels can be taken down or because Google said so (save the digital library).

1. Search videos: List new videos in subscribed channels, show known videos (aggregator);
2. Find single video, with unique identifier;
3. PLAY VIDEO IN OWN APPLICATION, not in the web browser;
4. Redistribute, share video torrent etc.
